# Version 2.0H for PC

This document describes the information found in the ``usr`` directory 
(installed under ``c:\ultra\usr``) of the **2.0H** PC version of the N64 OS.

The first line of the README mentions 1997-03-19:

```console
$ head -1 readme.20h
1997.3.19       2.0H(PC)
```

So the year of the release notes is assumed to be 1997.
