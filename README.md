# n64os-info

The official Nintendo 64 SDK that was sent to developers was split among a number of discs [[1]][[2]], 
among that the **Nintendo 64 OS (N64 OS)** which contained e.g. release notes, documentation, libultra, C headers, object files and microcode.

The N64 OS is not to be confused with the 'kernel' that runs on the N64 as 
[mentioned](https://ultra64.ca/files/documentation/online-manuals/man/pro-man/pro06/index.html) 
in the online manuals. 

## Versions

The following table provides [mostly documented](sources-n64os/README.md) information on all known versions of the N64 OS which were released for RCP 1.0 and/or RCP 2.0:
